Information for stars.bsc5dat
=============================

Description
-----------
This database table uses the data file from the 5th Revised Edition of the
Bright Star Catalog (BSC) and puts it into a table named "bsc5dat". This
catalog is also known as "Yale Bright Star Catalog" or "Harvard Revised".

The BSC is widely used for stars brighter than magnitude 6.5. This revision
of the catalog was published in 1991. It contains 9110 objects, of which 9096
are stars. In addition to the data file, there is an extensive remarks file
that gives more detailed information on individual entries.

Note: In the Stars Database, see the bsc5notes table for the remarks (aka
notes) data.

Notes:
(Only some of the information in these notes are from the ReadMe.)
  [0] Not all records have data after column 160 (after pmDE).
  [1] These fields are blank for star removed from BCS (see BCS Notes data).
      14 stars are removed, these are: 92, 95, 182, 1057, 1841, 2472, 2496,
      3515, 3671, 6309, 6515, 7189, 7539, 8296
  [2] Infrared Source Code:
      blank if from NASA merged Infrared Catalogue, Schmitz et al., 1978
      ' if from Engles et al. 1982
      : if uncertain identification
  [3] Multiple Code:
      A = Astrometric binary
      D = Duplicity discovered by occultation
      I = Innes, Southern Double Star Catalogue (1927)
      R = Rossiter, Michigan Publ. 9, 1955
      S = Duplicity discovered by speckle interferometry
      W = Worley (1978) update of the IDS
  [4] Visual Magnitude Code:
      blank = V on UBV Johnson system
      R = HR magnitudes reduced to the UBV system
      H = original HR magnitude
  [5] Uncertainty Flag Code is a blank, colon (:) or question mark (?).
      No information in ReadMe on what this means.
  [6] R-I System Code
      C = Cousin
      E = Eggen
      : is not specified by ReadMe
      ? is not specified by ReadMe
      D is not specified by ReadMe
  [7] Spectral Type Code is an e, v or t.
      No information in ReadMe on what this means.
  [8] As usually assumed, the proper motion in RA is the projected motion
      (cos(DE).d(RA)/dt), i.e. the total proper motion is sqrt(pmRA^2^+pmDE^2^)
  [9] Parallax Type Code
      blank if trigonometric parallax
      D if dynamical parallax
 [10] Radial Velocity Comments
      V  = variable radial velocity
      V? = suspected variable radial velocity
      SB, SB1, SB2, SB3 = spectroscopic binaries, single, double or triple
        lined spectra
      O = orbital data available
 [11] Rotational Velocity Limit Characters.
      The ReadME specificies this as a 2 character field which can have the
      following characters: < = > or blank. However, the data contains only
      blanks or =<
 [12] The data is actually numeric, not alphanumeric as implied in the ReadMe.
 [13] HR 966 has u_U-B code without having a U-B value. Possibly this code
      refers to the B-V value?
 [14] n_R-I may contain a blank (even when R-I has a value). None of the values
      in this field are a D
 [15] n_SpType may contain a blank (even when SpType has a value).
 [16] This field only contains "<" or "=<".
