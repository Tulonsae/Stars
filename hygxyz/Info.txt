Information for stars.hygxyz
============================

Description
-----------
This database table uses the hygxyz.csv data file from David Nash/astronexus
and puts it into a table named "hygxyz". Note that this data file does not
contain all the fields in the full HYG database.

The HYG database (v3.0) is a compilation of stellar data from a variety of
catalogs. It contains all stars in Hipparcos, Yale Bright Star, and Gliese
catalogs (almost 120k stars). The HYG name comes from the first letters of
Hipparcos, Yale, and Gliese. In addition, some values in the hygxyz.csv data
file were calculated by David Nash. See http://www.astronexus.com/hyg for
more information.

Note: the description on the website (and github) has the wrong order for
the ProperName. It is between BayerFlamsteed and RA, not after Dec. The csv
file lists the fields in the first line.

Data:
-----
  StarID - HYG ID
  HIP - Hipparcos Catalog ID
  HD - Henry Draper Catalog ID
  HR - Harvard Revised Catalog ID (same as in Yale Bright Star Catalog)
  Gliese - Gliese Catalog ID, from 3rd edition
  BayerFlamsteed - from Yale Bright Catalog, 5th edition, combines:
    Flamsteed number (if present)
    Bayer Greek letter
    Bayer superscript number (if present)
    constellation abbrieviation
  ProperName - the common name, mostly from Hipparcos website, about 100
  RA - right ascension, epoch 2000.0, in hms (converted to decimal) [1]
  Dec - declination, epoch 2000.0, in hms (converted to decimal) [1]
  Distance - distance in parsecs [2]
  PMRA - proper motion in right ascension, milliarcseconds per year
  PMDec - proper motion in declination, milliarcseconds per year
  RV - radial velocity, km/sec (where known)
  Mag - apparent visual magnitude
  AbsMag - absolute visual magnitude [3]
  Spectrum - spectral type, if known
  ColorIndex - color index (blue magnitude - visual magnitude), if known
  X - X Cartesian coordinate, in parsecs [4]
  Y - Y Cartesian coordinate, in parsecs [4]
  Z - Z Cartesian coordinate, in parsecs [4]
  VX - X Cartesian velocity coordinate, in parsecs/year [5]
  VY - Y Cartesian velocity coordinate, in parsecs/year [5]
  VZ - Z Cartesian velocity coordinate, in parsecs/year [5]
Notes:
  [1] Stars only in Gliese, which uses 1950.0 epoch had RA and Dec precessed
      to 2000.
  [2] For distance, a value of 10000000 indicates missing or dubious (e.g.,
      negative) parallax data in the Hipparcos catalog.
  [3] Absolute visual magnitude is the apparent magnitude from a distance of
      10 parsecs.
  [4] The Cartesian coordinates are based on the equatorial coordinates as
      seen from Earth, +X is in the direction of the vernal equinox (at epoch
      2000), +Z towards the north celestial pol, and +Y in the direction of
      R.A. 6 hours, declination 0 degrees.
  [5] Uses the same coordinate system described in Note [4]. The velocity
      components are determine from the proper motion and the raidal velocity
      (where known).
